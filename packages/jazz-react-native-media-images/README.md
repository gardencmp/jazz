# `jazz-react-native-media-images`

This is an optional add-on for `jazz-react-native` that provides support for creating `ImageDefinition`-compatible image sets from images provided as base64 data URIs.

In particular, it implements multi-resolution resizing based on `@bam.tech/react-native-image-resizer`.
