# Sharing data through Organizations

Organizations are a way to share a set of data between users.
Different apps have different names for this concept, such as "teams" or "workspaces".

We'll use the term Organization.

## Defining the schema for an Organization

Create a CoMap shared by the users of the same organization to act as a root (or "main database") for the shared data within an organization.

For this example, users within an `Organization` will be sharing `Project`s.

<CodeGroup>
```ts
// schema.ts
export class Project extends CoMap {
  name = co.string;
}

export class ListOfProjects extends CoList.Of(co.ref(Project)) {}

export class Organization extends CoMap {
  name = co.string;

  // shared data between users of each organization
  projects = co.ref(ListOfProjects);
}

export class ListOfOrganizations extends CoList.Of(co.ref(Organization)) {}
```
</CodeGroup>

Learn more about [defining schemas](/docs/schemas/covalues).

## Adding a list of Organizations to the user's Account

Let's add the list of `Organization`s to the user's Account `root` so they can access them.

<CodeGroup>
```ts
// schema.ts
export class JazzAccountRoot extends CoMap {
  organizations = co.ref(ListOfOrganizations);
}

export class JazzAccount extends Account {
  root = co.ref(JazzAccountRoot);

  async migrate(creationProps?: { name: string }) {
    super.migrate(creationProps);

    if (!this._refs.root) {
      // Using a Group as an owner allows you to give access to other users
      const initialOrganizationOwnership = {
        owner: Group.create({ owner: this }),
      };

      const organizations = ListOfOrganizations.create(
        [
          // Create the first Organization so users can start right away
          Organization.create(
            {
              name: "My organization",
              projects: ListOfProjects.create([], initialOrganizationOwnership),
            },
            initialOrganizationOwnership,
          ),
        ],
        { owner: this },
      );

      this.root = JazzAccountRoot.create(
        { organizations },
        { owner: this },
      );
    }
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

This schema now allows users to create `Organization`s and add `Project`s to them.

## Adding other users to an Organization

To give users access to an `Organization`, you can either send them an invite link, or
add their `Account` manually.

### Adding users through invite links

Here's how you can generate an [invite link](/docs/groups/sharing#invites).

When the user accepts the invite, add the `Organization` to the user's `organizations` list.

<CodeGroup>
```ts
const onAccept = (organizationId: ID<Organization>) => {
  if (me?.root?.organizations) {
    Organization.load(organizationId, me, []).then((organization) => {
      if (organization) {
        // Avoid duplicates
        const ids = me.root.organizations.map(
          (organization) => organization?.id,
        );

        if (ids.includes(organizationId)) return;

        me.root.organizations.push(organization);
        navigate("/organizations/" + organizationId);
      }
    });
  }
};

useAcceptInvite({
  invitedObjectSchema: Organization,
  onAccept,
});
```
</CodeGroup>
