# Groups as permission scopes

Every CoValue has an owner, which can be a `Group` or an `Account`.

You can use a `Group` to grant access to a CoValue to multiple users. These users can
have different roles, such as "writer", "reader" or "admin".

## Creating a Group

Here's how you can create a `Group`.

<CodeGroup>
```tsx
import { Group } from "jazz-tools";

const group = Group.create({ owner: me });
```
</CodeGroup>

The `Group` itself is a CoValue, and whoever owns it is an admin.

## Public sharing

You can share CoValues publicly by setting the `owner` to a `Group`, and granting
access to "everyone".

<CodeGroup>
```ts
const group = Group.create({ owner: me });
group.addMember("everyone", "writer"); // *highlight*
```
</CodeGroup>

This is done in the [chat example](https://github.com/garden-co/jazz/tree/main/examples/chat) where anyone can join the chat, and send messages.

## Adding group members by ID

You can add group members by ID by using `Account.load` and `Group.addMember`.

<CodeGroup>
```tsx
import { Group, Account } from "jazz-tools";

const group = Group.create({ owner: me });

const bob = await Account.load(bobsID, me, []);
group.addMember(bob, "writer");
```
</CodeGroup>

Note: if the account ID is of type `string`, because it comes from a URL parameter or something similar, you need to cast it to `ID<Account>` first:

<CodeGroup>
```tsx
import { Group, Account, ID } from "jazz-tools";

const bob = await Account.load(bobsID as ID<Account>, me, []);
group.addMember(bob, "writer");
```
</CodeGroup>
...more docs coming soon

## Getting the Group of an existing CoValue

You can get the group of an existing CoValue by using `coValue._owner`.

<CodeGroup>
```tsx
const group = existingCoValue._owner;
const newValue = MyCoMap.create(
  { color: "red"},
  { owner: group }
);
```
</CodeGroup>

Because `._owner` can be an `Account` or a `Group`, in cases where you specifically need to use `Group` methods (such as for adding members or getting your own role), you can cast it to assert it to be a Group:

<CodeGroup>
```tsx
import { Group } from "jazz-tools";

const group = existingCoValue._owner.castAs(Group);
group.addMember(bob, "writer");
group.myRole();
```
</CodeGroup>
