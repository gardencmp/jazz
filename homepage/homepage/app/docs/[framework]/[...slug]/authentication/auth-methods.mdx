# Authentication methods

Jazz supports a variety of authentication methods, which you can use to authenticate users in your app.

- Passphrase (built-in)
- Passkey (built-in)
- Clerk ([React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jazz-react-auth-clerk) and [vanilla](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jazz-browser-auth-clerk) packages)

## Passphrase

Passphrase authentication allows users to create a new account or log in with an existing one by providing a passphrase.

Passphrase authentication is supported out of the box and imported from `jazz-react`.

### How to use

1. Setup up Jazz as described in the [React setup guide](/docs/project-setup/react).

2. Use the `usePassphraseAuth` hook to authenticate.

<CodeGroup>
```ts
import { usePassphraseAuth } from "jazz-react";

// ...

const [passphraseAuth, passphraseState] = usePassphraseAuth({ appName });
```
</CodeGroup>

## Passkey

Passkey authentication allows users to create a new account or log in with an existing one by providing a passkey.

Passkey authentication is supported out of the box.

We have a [minimal example of a Clerk authentication setup](https://github.com/garden-co/jazz/tree/main/examples/clerk).

### How to use

1. Setup up Jazz as described in the [React setup guide](/docs/project-setup/react).

2. Use the `usePasskeyAuth` hook to authenticate.

<CodeGroup>
```ts
import { usePasskeyAuth } from "jazz-react";

// ...

const [passkeyAuth, passkeyState] = usePasskeyAuth({ appName });
```
</CodeGroup>

## Clerk

We have a React package `jazz-react-auth-clerk` to add Clerk authentication to your app. 

We have a [minimal example of a Clerk authentication setup](https://github.com/garden-co/jazz/tree/main/examples/minimal-auth-clerk).

### How to use

1. Setup up Jazz as described in the [React setup guide](/docs/project-setup/react).

2. Install Clerk as described in the [Clerk docs](https://clerk.com/docs/components/overview).

3. Then add the appropriate package to your project (e.g. `jazz-react-auth-clerk`).

<CodeGroup>
```bash
pnpm install jazz-react-auth-clerk
```
</CodeGroup>

4. Provide a Clerk instance to the `useJazzClerkAuth` hook.

<CodeGroup>
```tsx
import { useClerk, SignInButton } from "@clerk/clerk-react";
import { useJazzClerkAuth } from "jazz-react-auth-clerk";

// ...

function JazzAndAuth({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const clerk = useClerk();
  const [auth, state] = useJazzClerkAuth(clerk);

  return (
    <>
      {clerk.user && auth ? (
        <Jazz.Provider auth={auth}></Jazz.Provider>
      ) : (
        <SignInButton />
      )}
    </>
  );
}

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <ClerkProvider publishableKey={PUBLISHABLE_KEY} afterSignOutUrl="/">
      <JazzAndAuth>
        <App />
      </JazzAndAuth>
    </ClerkProvider>
  </StrictMode>,
);
```
</CodeGroup>
