# Sync and storage

## Using Jazz Cloud

Simply use `wss://cloud.jazz.tools/?key=...` as the sync server URL.

Jazz Cloud will
- sync CoValues in real-time between users and devices
- safely persist CoValues on redundant storage nodes with additional backups
- make use of geographically distributed cache nodes for low latency

### Free public alpha

- Jazz Cloud is free during the public alpha, with no strict usage limits
- We plan to keep a free tier, so you'll always be able to get started with zero setup
- See [Jazz Cloud pricing](/cloud#pricing) for more details
- ⚠️ Please use a valid email address as your API key.

    Your full sync server URL should look something like

    ```wss://cloud.jazz.tools/?key=you@example.com```

    Once we support per-app API keys, we'll email you an API key you can use instead.


## Running your own sync server

You can run your own sync server using:

```sh
npx jazz-run sync
```

And then use `ws://localhost:4200` as the sync server URL.

You can also run this simple sync server behind a proxy that supports WebSockets, for example to provide TLS.
In this case, provide the WebSocket endpoint your proxy exposes as the sync server URL.

### Command line options:

- `--port` / `-p` - the port to run the sync server on. Defaults to 4200.
- `--in-memory` - keep CoValues in-memory only and do sync only, no persistence. Persistence is enabled by default.
- `--db` - the path to the file where to store the data (SQLite). Defaults to `sync-db/storage.db`.

### Source code

The implementation of this simple sync server is available open-source [on GitHub](https://github.com/gardencmp/jazz/blob/main/packages/jazz-run/src/startSync.ts).
