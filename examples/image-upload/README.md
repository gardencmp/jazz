## Configuration: sync server

By default, the example app uses [Jazz Cloud](https://jazz.tools/cloud) (`wss://cloud.jazz.tools`) - so cross-device use, invites and collaboration should just work.

You can also run a local sync server by running `npx jazz-run sync` and adding the query param `?sync=ws://localhost:4200` to the URL of the example app (for example: `http://localhost:5173/?peer=ws://localhost:4200`), or by setting the `sync` parameter of `JazzProvider` component in [./src/main.tsx](./src/main.tsx).
