# Organization example with Jazz and React

This is an example of how to share a set of data between users through a CoMap called Organization. 
Different apps have different names for this concept, such as "teams" or "workspaces".

Refer to the [documentation](https://jazz.tools/docs/react/design-patterns/organization)  for more information.

## Installing & running the example locally

(This requires `pnpm` to be installed, see [https://pnpm.io/installation](https://pnpm.io/installation))

Start by downloading the [jazz repository](https://github.com/garden-co/jazz):
```bash
npx degit gardencmp/jazz jazz
```

Go to the organization example directory:
```bash
cd jazz/examples/organization
```

Install and build dependencies:
```bash
pnpm i && npx turbo build
```

Start the dev server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Configuration: sync server

By default, the example app uses [Jazz Cloud](https://jazz.tools/cloud) (`wss://cloud.jazz.tools`) - so cross-device use, invites and collaboration should just work.

You can also run a local sync server by running `npx jazz-run sync` and adding the query param `?sync=ws://localhost:4200` to the URL of the example app (for example: `http://localhost:5173/?peer=ws://localhost:4200`), or by setting the `sync` parameter of the `<Jazz.Provider>` provider component in [./src/main.tsx](./src/main.tsx).
